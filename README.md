Chess Engine Project - C#
This was my first ever attempt at making a chess engine, and my first ever project in C#.

It utilises a Min-Max algorithm to calculate the best moves. For the interface, local play is implemented to allow hotseat playing. C# vector graphics are used for the UI (other than the pieces.)

There is a lot of room for improvement in efficiency of the algorithm, the main issue is not the Min-Max but the processing of the chess rules to calculate moves. 

If I was to continue the project, I would look at other people's implementations and work on improving the moveset calculation speed dramatically.
However, for a first project and designing all the code myself, I am happy with the outcome.
